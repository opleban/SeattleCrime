CenturyLink Field Crime Data

MVP - Basic Sinatra-based responsive website displaying crime within a one-mile radius of CenturLink Field. Most basic version will have a map and basic bar graph by crime type.

I originally intended to display a map and data visualizations of criminal incidences around CenturyLink Field focusing on days the Seahawks had home games. However, I was not able to get the SoQL query working correctly. The remnants of that idea still remain on the page with a dropdown menu allowing the selection of opposing team names and season years. I also have included a JSON files with information on each Seahawk home game during the regular season for 2012-2014.
